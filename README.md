Contributing

Only members (Vivek, Heramb, Harsh, Asish) can contribute here.You can always fork the reporitories in this orgranization to resolve issues or make new contribution and submit pull request to merge it.

Do consult us before you start contributing for appropriate assignments of tasks and better understanding of the architecture.

You can also contribute feeding data into any of the ongoing projects here. You can go to the project website and start uploading data or you can upload raw files on the repositories. We insist on opening an issue (or disucssing in a appropriate existing issue) before you upload any raw file. If possible, developer contributors may be able to make a UI for it to upload and parse the data easily.

Any idea or suggestions will be appreciated.
